Inspector Project
=================

What Inspector is NOT
---------------------

* A monitoring solution
* A new standard for audit
* A project defining a hard standard of audit

What Inspector is
-----------------

* A project to bring alignment and collaboration in order to get proper audit
  information from the OPNFV components.
* An effort to fill the gaps in the information that's provided by the
  infrastructure components.

  - This will be achieved by inspector being the place to put
    bug-reports/wish-list items for more detailed information from the infra.
* An effort to bring sustainable audit where it's not existing already.

  - e.g. bring audit to OpenDaylight or components of OpenStack that are
    missing it.
